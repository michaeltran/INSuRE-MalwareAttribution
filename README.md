## Project Description
  
> Attribution of cyber-attacks is a critical, unsolved problem. Many markers of cyber-attack are unreliable, readily falsified, and transient. For many cyber-attacks, malware is an enduring artifact that can be used for attribution. Malware often comes as an executable file, which must conform to a specification in order to function properly. There is a great deal of metadata in executable files - such as when created, how many sections, what library calls are imported, etc. - that can be used as features for attribution analysis. Characteristics embedded in the malware executable provide artifacts of the attackers that created it. Malware is increasingly complex and heterogeneous, incorporating components from multiple sources and involving multiple actors, and attribution analysis must account for this complexity.

> In this research, we are investigating the malware software development life cycle to identify artifacts that remain in the final executable binary enabling attribution. Because malware development uses many of the same tools and processes as software development for typical "goodware" applications, we can study malware development as a special case of the general software development life cycle. We will conduct experimentation on open source applications to explore and evaluate artifacts for authorship and attribution analysis, then apply those findings to malware dataset experimentation. Students will extract potential features from executable binaries, traced back to ground truth author information, and conduct analysis to identify which features are most promising for attribution.

## How to Run

### Data

**NOTE**: Before downloading the data, ensure that the `/data` folder is excluded from any scans from anti-virus software. If it is not, your anti-virus software will quarantine and/or delete the data.

To load the static and dynamic data, run the following command:

```Rich Text Format
python ./code/helpers/report_downloader.py -r "." -t "virustotal"
python ./code/helpers/report_downloader.py -r "." -t "cuckoo"
```

The following folders should appear in `/data`:

* /data/dynamic_cuckoo
* /data/static_vt

### Preprocessing Data

Run the following command:

```Rich Text Format
python ./code/MalwareAttribution/Preprocessing.py -d "data"
```

This will extract the features from static (Virus Total) and dynamic (Cuckoo) reports and nicely split the classes and features into `test_data.csv`, `train_data.csv` and `validate_data.csv`.

### Classifier

Run the following command:

```Rich Text Format
python ./code/MalwareAttribution/MalwareAttribution.py -d "data"
```

This will use the preprocessed data from the previous step and vectorize the data. It will then run leave-one-out experiments with 10-fold cross-validation.

Afterwards it will test the static and dynamic data using a Naive Bayes classifier, SVM classifier, and Bagging with Decision Tree base estimator Classifier.
